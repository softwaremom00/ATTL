         <p>“In many primitive cultures weaving, spinning and dyeing constitute one of the major occupations, possibly second only to farming. In our technical society, because we are free from the need to pursue these crafts, the majority of us are not acquainted with the pleasure they give.  Undoubtedly it is in man’s nature to be creative, and although few of us would trade our lives for the hardships of primitive man, we do find satisfaction in creating objects for our own use, or just things of beauty to have or to give to a friend.” by Rachel Brown</p>
