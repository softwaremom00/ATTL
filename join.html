        <h2>Guild History and Information</h2>
        <p>Art Through The Loom Guild was founded more than thirty-five years ago in the Northern Rio Grande Valley with the idea of training youth to work with traditional Chimay√≥ weavers. It was the hope of members that by doing this, weaving traditions would be handed down through generations. The guild presents weaving exhibitions and promotes weaving and hand-spinning skills.  Although the guild was begun on the premise of handing down traditional weaving practices, it is by no means limited to traditional looking pieces.</p>
        <p>Our focus is on weaving, spinning, and dyeing, and, to a lesser extent on techniques that use handwoven, handspun, or hand-dyed materials including knit and crochet items, dolls, and colcha.</p>

        <p>Guild members participate as a group in three to four shows and sales each year. We sponsor workshops and discussions focused on developing a successful fiber arts career.</p>

         <h2>Membership and Dues</h2>
         <p>The Guild year runs from July 1 through June 30. Dues are $25 per year. To join or renew for the current Guild year, send your check, made out to ATTL to:</p>
